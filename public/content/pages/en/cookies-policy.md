## Cookies Policy

### Last updated: 08/09/2025

At **MotoPlus** (“we”, “us”, “our”), we respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we use cookies when you access our website and services (the “Site”). This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, and your choices regarding cookies.

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They help websites function properly and remember certain information during your visit.

### How We Use Cookies

We only use **strictly necessary cookies**, which are essential for the operation of our Site. Without these cookies, our services would not function correctly.

Examples include:

- **Session cookies** – to keep you logged in as you navigate the Site.
- **Cart cookies** – to remember items you place in your shopping basket.
- **Security cookies** – to help us protect your account and prevent fraudulent activity.

### No Analytics or Marketing Cookies

We do **not** use cookies for:

- Tracking your activity across websites
- Advertising or remarketing
- Analytics or traffic measurement

### How Long Do We Keep Cookies?

Most of our essential cookies are **session-based** and are deleted once you close your browser. Some cookies (such as login preferences) may last longer, but only for as long as necessary to provide the service.

### Managing Cookies

Because our cookies are strictly necessary, they cannot be disabled through our Site. You may configure your browser to block or delete cookies, but this may prevent the Site from functioning properly.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Cookies Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised “Last updated” date.
